I will describe my efforts to develop interactive graphical tools for genetic data, using JavaScript and D3. (The tools are available as an R package: R/qtlcharts, http://kbroman.org/qtlcharts) I will focus on an expression genetics experiment in the mouse, with gene expression microarray data on each of six tissues, plus high-density genotype data, in each of 500 mice. I argue that in research with such data, precise statistical inference is not so important as data visualization."""

I will discuss my personal struggles to make my work reproducible and will present a series of suggested steps on the path towards reproducibility (see http://kbroman.org/steps2rr)."""

In the United States, rare diseases affect 30 million patients in approximately 7000 disease areas. Causal inference to inform therapy decisions in this area is challenged by several factors: the patient population is small, the genotype or phenotype is variable, and the disease pathways can be uncharacterized or lengthy. These challenges are not specific to the rare disease setting as they apply more largely to answering causal inference questions in the era of precision medicine where public health decisions rely on subgroups of sample sizes. In 2019, the Food and Drug Administration published documents guiding best practices on data collection, study design and use of registry data in the rare diseases setting. Over the past few years, a few algorithms were published to guide researchers to appropriate study design. This presentation will give an overview of best design practices and innovative analysis methods and illustrate their use with case studies in rare diseases."""
"""2016-02-29"""	"""Dr. Arzu-Onar Thomas """	"""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"""	"""A critical look at non-inferiority trials: benefits and pitfalls"""	"""Non-inferiority trials have the potential to be extremely useful and are designs of choice when placebo controlled trials are not ethical or when a new treatment is thought to be similar in primary outcome to standard of care but may have advantages in secondary endpoints such as quality of life, cost, compliance etc. Designing and conducting non-inferiority trials however can be a lot more challenging compared to a superiority trial as the sources of bias are more abundant and lurk at unusual places such as in intent-to-treat populations etc. Furthermore full interpretation of results may rely on information outside of the trial itself making non-inferiority trials vulnerable to hazards of non-randomized trials. In this talk, I will try to outline some of the issues that need to be taken into account when designing and running a non-inferiority trial and provide guidance regarding best-practices. I will also discuss potential biases that may be present and discuss proper ways of analyzing the data and interpreting the results. The talk will primarily focus on conceptual aspects rather than mathematical details and is intended for statisticians, physician scientists as well as others involved in operational aspects of clinical trials."""

The D3 library can allow researchers to build interactive data visualizations for exploration using a wide variety of charts, networks, and graphs. These visualizations can further help researchers communicate their findings in presentations, and answers questions with on-the-fly interactive investigation of their data. In this presentation, I will go over the basics of the D3 library. I will also demonstrate its potential by exploring a collaborative network visualization of UTHSC researchers. I will explore the co-authorship patterns between basic and clinical scientists, investigate sub-structures, and explore the publication history of prominent co-authorship communities using the network as a guide for exploration."""
"""2016-04-04"""	"""Dr. Jonathan S. Schildcrout """	"""Vanderbilt University"""	"""Epidemiological sampling designs for longitudinal binary data with application to spirometery-based COPD diagnosis"""	"""We discuss an epidemiological study design and analyses approach for longitudinal binary response data.  Similar to other epidemiological study designs, we seek to gain efficiency and increase power compared to standard designs by over-sampling relatively informative subjects for inclusion into the sample.  In particular, we will discuss a design that conducts a case-control sample (i.e., sample cases with high probability and controls with low probability); however, subjects are then followed longitudinally and case-control status is observed repeatedly for each subject. If the sampling variable (case-control status at baseline) is closely related to the binary response (case-control status over time), we are able to observe a sample that is highly enriched with case-visits compared to a standard random sampling design.  We may therefore realize a substantial improvements in power and efficiency.  However, because the design over-samples case-days, we must acknowledge the non-representativeness of the sample when conducting statistical analyses.  We will describe a sequentially offsetted regression approach for valid inferences.  Motivated by data provided by the Lung Health Study we will show that targeted sampling designs can yield valid inferences and can be far more resource efficient than standard random sampling designs for longitudinal data."""
"""2016-04-18"""	"""Dr. Stanley Pounds """	"""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital """	"""Profiling Dialysis Facilities for Adverse Recurrent Events"""	"""Profiling analysis aims to evaluate health care providers, such as hospitals, nursing homes, or dialysis facilities, with respect to a patient outcome. Previous profiling methods have considered binary outcomes, such as 30-day hospital readmission or mortality. For the unique population of dialysis patients, regular blood works are required to evaluate effectiveness of treatment and avoid adverse events, including dialysis inadequacy, imbalance mineral levels, and anemia among others. For example, anemic events (when hemoglobin levels exceed normative range) are recurrent and common for patients on dialysis. Thus, we propose high-dimensional Poisson and negative binomial regression models for rate/count outcomes and introduce a standardized event ratio (SER) measure to compare the event rate at a specific facility relative to a chosen normative standard, typically defined as an ?average? national rate across all facilities. Our proposed estimation and inference procedures overcome the challenge of high-dimensional parameters for thousands of dialysis facilities. Also, we investigate how overdispersion affects inference in the context of profiling analysis. (manuscript: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/sim.8482)"""
"""2016-04-25"""	"""Dr. Parichoy Pal Chounhury """	"""Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health """	"""Causal Effect Among The Treated: Multiple Data Sources and Censored Outcomes"""	"""We develop an inferential framework for estimating the causal effect among ""exposed"" subjects on a time-to-event outcome, based on multiple data sources and censored outcome information. We conceptualize a hypothetical point exposure study where subjects are enrolled and allowed to select their own exposure. Using information from two data sources (one for exposed subjects and one for non-exposed subjects with multiple examination times), we describe a process of manufacturing a dataset that closely mimics this hypothetical study. The identification of the causal effect relies on a no unmeasured confounding assumption based on covariates available at exposure selection and a non-informative censoring assumption. Estimation proceeds by fitting separate proportional hazards regression models for exposed and non-exposed subjects using the manufactured dataset and using G-computation to estimate, for exposed subjects, the distributions of time-to-event under exposure and non-exposure. Using these estimated distributions, we compute a parsimonious measure of the causal effect of interest."""
"""2016-05-23"""	"""Dr. Hyeonju Kim """	"""Preventive Medicine, UTHSC"""	"""Probabilities of Ruin in Economics and Insurance under Light- and Heavy-tailed Distributions"""	"""This research is conducted on ruin problems in two fields. First, the ruin or survival of an economic agent over finite and infinite time horizons is explored for a one-good economy. A recursive relation derived for the intractable ruin distribution is used to compute its moments. A new system of Chebyshev inequalities, using an optimal allocation of different orders of moments over different ranges of the initial stock, provide good conservative estimates of the true ruin distribution. The second part of the research is devoted to the study of ruin probabilities in the general renewal model of insurance under both light- and heavy-tailed claim size distributions. Recent results on the dual problem of equilibrium of the Lindley-Spitzer Markov process provide clues to the orders of magnitude of finite time ruin probabilities in insurance."""

I will outline how to write R code with speedy execution in mind and how to investigate where computation time is spent in your R function by profiling your R execution.  A life demonstration will show how R code can be compiled for faster execution as well as demonstrate how to create and utilize multiple cores that your hardware provides.  We will specifically address (pseudo) random number generation and repeatability of parallel/distributed computing as a cornerstone of reproducible research.  All techniques are demonstrated in a Windows 10 environment but are generally applicable to UNIX and Macintosh systems as well."""
"""2016-10-03"""	"""Josh Callaway """	"""CEO/Co-founder/Data Scientist, PendulumRock Analytics, LLC"""	""" The Next Generation of Data Analysis"""	"""According to Moore's Law, the number of transistors on a microchip doubles nearly every 2 years.  As we are now approaching this theoretical limit, Ray Kurzweil points out that technological performance will enter a new paradigm of quantum computing, neuromorphic chips, and 3-D stacking.  We can well extrapolate a similar paradigm shift in many other realms of information technology.  Apps are replacing the middle man and rendering life cheaper in nearly any service imaginable from the hotel industry to hailing a taxi or ordering food.  It appears very likely, as well, that apps will make their way into medical diagnosis and rental services for autonomous self-driving cars.  The boon of this app awakening manifests in the acceleration of declining costs and easy accessibility.  In developing countries, such technology is providing business opportunity where it was previously too expensive.  And, this is not limited to consumer services.  The proliferation of Big Data and high-performance computing has broken barriers in statistics.  Ten years ago, an analytical model that today takes 10 minutes to compute might have taken 10 days.  Furthermore, this is not merely limited to high-cost licensed commercial software.  Breakthroughs have been realized that allow smaller institutions and individuals to spread the work of programming across multiple processes.  Additionally, cheap production of statistical applications is now plausible through open-source platforms.  Therefore, we may be witnessing an analytical singularity in which nearly-instantaneous output can be produced from low-cost input.  Already underway, this is providing a mainspring in technical startups and will fuel a similar paradigm shift in statistics and analytics"""
"""2017-03-27"""	"""Dr. Fridtjof Thomas """	"""Preventive Medicine, UTHSC"""	""" P-values: Too Big To Fail?"""	"""This seminar outlines what we like about p-values and in which situations they are inherently meaningful.  The participant will then get an understanding why their use is somewhat less straight forward in situations arising in observational studies and when very many hypotheses are tested (multiplicity of testing problem).  Details are given why p-values cannot serve as measures of support for a specific hypothesis and why they do not measure ""strength of scientific evidence"" in a general sense.  The American Statistical Association has recently issued recommendations on P-values and reporting of statistical analyses and the Journal of Basic and Applied Social Psychology has banned P values altogether from its research articles.  Are P values still around because they are inherently beneficial or have they simply become so prolific that they are ""too big to fail""?"""

While traditional patient monitors in the ICU have been used to generate large volumes of continuous physiological data from sensors attached the patient, analytics applied to those systems have largely been univariate and limited. Use of big data approaches, such as continuous and longitudinal event stream analytics through open source software such as Apache Spark allows us to analyze multiple channels of physiological data for prediction of potentially devastating conditions prior to their clinical manifestation. The use of novel discretization and machine learning methods allow us to identify salient 'physiomarkers', such as reduced heart rate variability or arrhythmias. This presentation will highlight recent work and new directions we are progressing at the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital."""
"""2017-07-24"""	"""Dr. Demba Fofana """	"""University of Texas Rio Grande Valley """	"""Gene Expression and Network Analysis"""	"""Analyzing gene expression data rigorously requires taking assumptions into consideration but also relies on using information about network relations that exist among genes. Combining these different elements cannot only improve statistical power, but also provide a better framework through which gene expression can be properly analyzed. We propose a novel statistical model that combines assumptions and gene network information into the analysis. Assumptions are important since every test statistic is valid only when required assumptions hold. We incorporate gene network information into the analysis because neighboring genes share biological functions. This correlation factor is taken into account via similar prior probabilities for neighboring genes. With a series of simulations, our approach is compared with other approaches. Our method that combines assumptions and network information into the analysis is shown to be more powerful."""

However, there has been little development in statistical tools to verify this model assumption and assess the goodness-of-fit of real world data (Realized Volatility). When a L?vy driven CARMA(2,1) is observed at high frequencies, the unobserved driving process can be approximated from the observed process. Since, under general conditions, the L?vy driven CARMA(2,1) can be written as a sum of two dependent L\'evy driven CAR(1) process, the methods developed in Abdelrazeq, Ivanoff, and Kulik (2014) can be employed in order to use the approximated increments of the driving process to test the assumption that the process is L?vy-driven. The performance of the test is illustrated through simulation and real world data."""
"""2017-08-22"""	"""Dr. Laura Saba """	"""University of Colorado at Denver """	"""Animal models and statistical strategies for describing the transcriptional connectome and its role in complex traits"""	"""Rarely are the exact same genes associated with a complex phenotype in different populations, e.g., different recombinant inbred rodent panels, different human populations, or different species. In most cases, it is the biological pathway that is important in the etiology of disease rather than an individual gene. In our first analysis, information across several rat populations is combined to identify a set of co-expressed genes in brain that predispose to alcohol-related traits using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and quantitative trait loci. At the heart of this co-expression module is an unannotated transcript that is likely to be a non-coding transcript. When this unannotated transcript is genetically manipulated, not only does the phenotype of interest, alcohol consumption, change but also the transcription levels of many other genes are also altered. This statistical model provides insight about relevant biological processes but may not give detail about the directed pathway from genotype to disease necessary to identify potential therapeutic targets. In an additional study, we performed a similar WGCNA analysis of liver RNA expression levels and associated modules and genetic variants with alcohol metabolism-related phenotypes. In this study, we identified a module that contains multiple isoforms of alcohol dehydrogenase, which is known to have a major role in the metabolism of alcohol to acetaldehyde. Using this co-expression module, we also explored the application of Bayesian networks to further hypothesize about the direction of relationships between transcripts using Mendelian randomization. This model further distinguished transcripts."""

As we increase the complexity of our models, we usually decrease the bias in its prediction. However, increasing model complexity also tends to make the predictions more variable or unstable. In this expository talk, we will examine how the bias-variance tradeoff is exhibited in the context of some common statistical learning methods such as k-nearest neighbors, multiple linear regression, gradient boosting machines, and regularized regression. We will examine their performance in the context of predicting plant fitness using genomewide genotype data."""

Commonly used algorithms include iteratively reweighted least squares (IWLS) and Newton-Raphson methods.  If the objective function depends on a large number of parameters, is not smooth, or is difficult to compute, other methods are needed.  In statistics the EM algorithm is a common choice; in machine learning proximal gradient algorithms are useful. It turns out that both are special cases of the MM (minorization-maximization) algorithm.  This method is guaranteed to improve the objective function in each iteration under general conditions.

Adolescence transition (puberty) is considered associated with DNA-M change and this change is gender specific. In adolescence, a gender reversal of asthma prevalence occurs, from male predominance of asthma prevalence in young childhood to female predominance after adolescence. Given that DNA methylation may play a central role in susceptibility to asthma, assessing the stability of DNA-M provides a potential to understand the mechanisms of asthma transition during adolescence. The aim of this study was to identify dynamic and stable DNA-M at the genome scale and assess their gender-specificity. Data from children at 10 and 18 years old from the Isle of Wight birth(IOW) cohort in the United Kingdom were included. Epigenome-scale DNA-M was assessed using Illumina 450K and 850k EPIC platforms. Linear mixed models with repeated measures were implemented in our analysis. We identified 15,532 CpG sites were dynamic during adolescence transition in both genders, the level of DNA-M at 1,179 CpG sites is not stable during adolescence transition and this change is gender specific.

The limited available methods focus on the selection of non-zero individual variables for a single outcome. However, variable selection in the presence of grouped covariates is often required. Some methods are available for the selection of non-zero group and within-group variables for the Cox proportional hazards model. There are no available methods to perform group variable selection in the clustered multivariate survival setting. In this context, the hierarchical adaptive group bridge penalty is proposed to select non-zero group and within-group variables for the independent or clustered marginal multivariate proportional hazards model. Simulation studies show the hierarchical adaptive group bridge method has superior performance compared to the extension of the adaptive group bridge in terms of variable selection accuracy. Sometimes, survival data suffers from high-dimensional group variables. Most existing screening methods address the sure screening property for individual variable selection. The sure group joint variable screening method is proposed to screen independent and clustered multivariate survival data in the presence of group variables. Simulation studies show the sure group joint variable screening method performs better than existing screening procedures extended to the multivariate survival setting.

One major difficulty is caused by the small sample size of the training data set in most toxicology problems. Thus, how to utilize data most efficiently takes a premium in predictive modeling of toxicity, and it requires some creative techniques not commonly used in settings with copious amount of data. In this presentation, several examples on how to perform statistical modeling and machine learning in toxicity testing within the constraints of small sample sizes will be discussed. In the first example, a robust learning method was applied to the prediction of the point of departure so that a small portion of outlier chemicals will not harm the overall performance of the model.

To handle the missing order, we model twin data by a mixture bivariate distribution and estimate under two likelihood functions: the likelihood over the monozygotic and dizygotic twins separately, and the likelihood over the two twin types combined. Both likelihood estimators are consistent. More importantly, the combined likelihood overcomes the drawback of mixture distribution estimation, namely, the slow convergence.

Clinical and echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function was performed at baseline and follow-up evaluations and graded per a modified version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Extreme gradient boosting (XGboost) algorithms were applied, and model performance evaluated by 5-fold stratified cross validation.Results: Median age at baseline evaluation was 31.7 years (range 18.4-66.4), and median age at cancer diagnosis was 8.4 years (range 0.01 ?C 22.7). The average length of follow-up time following baseline SJLIFE evaluation was 5 years (0.5-9). Among survivors, 67.1% were exposed to chest radiation (median dose of 1,200 cGy (4-6,200 cGy) and 76.6% were exposed to anthracyclines (mean dose of 168.7 mg/m2 (35.1-734.2 mg/m2).

Several ASCNA tools have recently been developed, but they have been limited to the identification of subclone regions, and not the genotype of subclones.

This property has been demonstrated via simulation in multiple prior research articles. However, we have seen no theoretical explanation as to why this should be so. This paper provides that theoretical proof. Furthermore, this paper presents a method for performing the necessary variable selection by means of elastic net regression, and then estimating the propensity scores so as to obtain optimal estimates of average treatment effect.

While machine learning propensity models provide numerous benefits, they do not produce a single variable balancing score that can be used for propensity score stratification and matching. This issue motivates the development of a flexible ordinal propensity scoring methodology that does not require parametric assumptions for the propensity model. The proposed method fits a one-parameter power function to the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the generalized propensity score (GPS) vector resulting from any machine learning propensity model, and is called the GPS-CDF method. The estimated parameter from the GPS-CDF method, ?, is a scalar balancing score that can be used to group similar subjects in outcome analyses. Specifically, subjects who received different levels of the treatment are stratified or matched based on their ? value to produce unbiased estimates of the average treatment effect (ATE). Simulation studies presented show remediation of covariate balance, minimal bias in ATEs, and maintain coverage probability.

Using principles of Mendelian genetics, Bayesian probability theory, and variant-specific knowledge, Mendelian models derive the probability of carrying a pathogenic variant and developing cancer in the future, based on family history. Existing Mendelian models are widely employed, but are generally limited to specific genes and syndromes. However, the upsurge of multi-gene panel germline testing has spurred the discovery of many new gene-cancer associations that are not presently accounted for in these models. We have developed PanelPRO, a flexible, efficient Mendelian risk prediction framework that can incorporate an arbitrary number of genes and cancers, overcoming the computational challenges that arise because of the increased model complexity. Using simulations and a clinical cohort with germline panel testing data, we evaluate model performance, validate the reverse-compatibility of our approach with existing Mendelian models, and illustrate its usage."""

Project 1: Gene-based association tests are widely used in GWAS. The power of a test is often limited by the sample size, the effect size, and the number of causal variants or their directions in a gene. In addition, access to individual-level data is often limited. To resolve the existing limitations, we proposed an optimally weighted combination (OWC) test based on summary statistics from GWAS. We analytically proved that aggregating the variants in one gene is the same as using the weighted combination of Z-scores for each variant based on the proposed score test. Several existing methods are special cases. We also numerically illustrated that our proposed test outperforms several existing methods via simulation studies. Furthermore, we utilized schizophrenia GWAS data and fasting glucose GWAS meta-analysis data to demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing methods in real data analyses. Project 2: We used a carefully curated list of 87 previously published genetic variants to determine whether the incorporation of genetic variants with non-genetic variables could improve the identification of cancer survivors at risk for anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy. We used anthracycline-exposed childhood cancer survivors from a ChildrenÕs Oncology Group study (COG-ALTE03N1: 146 cases; 195 matched controls) as the discovery set. Replication was performed in two anthracycline-exposed survivor populations: i) childhood cancer survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS: 126 cases; 250 controls); ii) autologous blood or marrow transplantation (BMT) survivors from the BMT Survivor Study (BMTSS: 80 cases; 78 controls). The Clinical+Genetic model performed better than the Clinical Model in COG-ALTE03N1 (AUC of Clinical+Genetic Model = 0.88 vs. AUC of Clinical Model = 0.81) and BMTSS (AUC of Clinical+Genetic Model = 0.72 vs. AUC of Clinical Model = 0.64), but not in CCSS (AUC of Clinical+Genetic Model = 0.88 vs. AUC of Clinical Model = 0.89). However, the Clinical+Genetic model performed marginally better in CCSS patients without CVRFs where cardiomyopathy developed within 30 years of anthracycline exposure (AUC of Clinical+Genetic Model = 0.90 vs. AUC of Clinical Model = 0.85).

BUS is capable of correcting batch effects explicitly, grouping samples that share similar characteristics into subtypes, identifying features that distinguish subtypes, and enjoying a linear-order computational complexity. We prove the identifiability of BUS for not only bulk data but also scRNA-seq data whose dropout events suffer from missing not at random. We mathematically show that under two very flexible and realistic experimental designsÑthe Òreference panelÓ and the Òchain-typeÓ designsÑtrue biological variability can also be separated from batch effects. Moreover, despite the active research on analysis methods for scRNA-seq data, rigorous statistical methods to estimate treatment effects for scRNA-seq dataÑhow an intervention or exposure alters the cellular composition and gene expression levelsÑare still lacking.

Lamian is a comprehensive and statistically-rigorous computational framework for differential multi-sample pseudotime analysis. It can be used to identify changes in a biological process associated with sample covariates, such as different biological conditions, and also to detect changes in gene expression, cell density, and topology of a pseudotemporal trajectory.

Recent developments in genotype-omics studies have shown promises for discovering novel loci by leveraging genetically regulated molecular phenotypes (e.g., gene expression, methylation, proteomics) into GWAS. However, there is a limitation in the existing approaches. Some variants can individually influence disease risk through alternative functional mechanisms. Existing approaches of testing only the association of imputed molecular phenotypes will potentially lose power. To tackle this challenge, we consider a unified mixed effects model that formulates the association of intermediate phenotypes such as imputed gene expression through fixed effects, while allowing for residual effects of individual variants as random effects. We consider a set-based score testing framework, MiST (Mixed effects Score Test), and propose data-driven combination approaches to jointly test for the fixed and random effects. We also provide p-values for fixed and random effects separately to enhance interpretability of the association signals. Recently, we extend the MiST to depend on only GWAS summary statistics instead of individual level data, allowing for a broad application of MiST to GWAS data. Extensive simulations demonstrate that MiST is more powerful than existing approaches and summary statistics-based MiST (sMiST) agrees well those obtained from individual level data with substantively improved computational speed.

However, our knowledge of their cellular composition and organization remains limited. Recently we published an integrated cellular and spatial atlas of 26 primary human breast cancers spanning all major molecular subtypes1. This provided a systematic, high-resolution, characterization of the cellular diversity of the epithelial, immune and stromal cellular landscape. To investigate neoplastic cell heterogeneity, we developed a single cell classifier of intrinsic subtype (scSubtype) and revealed recurrent transcriptional gene modules that define the neoplastic cells. This detailed cellular taxonomy was then used to deconvolute large breast cancer cohorts, allowing their stratification into nine clusters, termed ÔecotypesÕ, with unique cellular compositions and association with clinical outcome. Further, Visium spatial profiling provided an initial view of how stromal, immune and neoplastic cells are spatially organized in tumours, offering insights into tumour regulation. This work is now being expanded to the generation and integration of 100s of cellular profiles and a matching dataset of spatially resolved tumour transcriptomes.

This is difficult because GWAS produces information about SNPs rather than genes, however SNPs are inherently species specific. My lab is helping to develop two complementary methods to address this problem. Both methods depend on translation of GWAS signals from SNPs to genes. In one method, this is done by choosing the gene that is nearest to an implicated SNP. The list of orthologous genes from two or more species are then projected into a previously defined gene network and a random walk is used to defuse the signal to neighboring genes. The overlap between the network defined by each species is then assessed for significance relative to permuted gene sets. In the second method, SNPs are used to predict gene expression and these predictions are used to estimate the effect of each geneÕs expression on phenotype, creating what we term a polygenetic transcriptomic risk score (PTRS). A PTRS can then be used in conjunction with orthologous genes such that a PTRS defined in one species can be used to estimate an analogous trait in individuals from another species. In preliminary work we found that both methods identify highly statistically significant overlap in the signals associated with both BMI and body length.

While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for causal inference in health research, they are impossible or unethical in many common scenarios. Mendelian randomization (MR) can be used where RCTs are not feasible, but it requires stringent assumptions that can be fundamentally flawed when applied to complex traits. Some assumptions of MR can be avoided with using structural equation modeling. In this paper we developed an extension of the Direction of Causation twin model (Neale 1994) that includes two polygenic risk scores in the specification, as an approach to avoid some inherent restrictions of both MR and RCT. We hypothesize that adding a second PRS will generate a more flexible model in terms of identification, whilst maintaining reasonable power and allowing for bidirectional causation. OpenMx software is used to explore the power of such a model and its identification. We arrive at an extension of the Direction of Causation model that can be used both in a twin design or in a extended family design, but at the same time relaxing some of MRs assumptions. We further report the model is well powered enough for current data set sizes (from around 13000 observations or less, depending on the variance of the instruments), and in a range of additive, shared and environmental variances found in common clinical scenarios."""

People carrying two variants in APOL1 are at increased risk of developing a variety of kidney disease. The mechanism by which APOL1 alters kidney function is currently unclear. To investigate potential mechanisms, we have looked at differences in DNA methylation across the genome and metabolomic profiles. Using 1740 African Americans (AA) in the ARIC study and 3886 Hispanic/Latinos in SOL, we did not observe any statistically significant differences in metabolism in preliminary analyses after adjusting for multiple comparisons. In 947 AAs in ARIC, 949 AAs in JHS and 332 AAs in MESA, we identified extensive differences in methylation near the APOL gene family region on chromosome 22 (p=2.7x10-80).

The Vector in Partition (VIP) algorithm fills this gap with a distance measure designed to partition genetic and epigenetic data with non-equal length dimensions; specifically, gene expression (GE), DNA methylation (CPG), and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). The VIP extension method extends this framework by adding another layer of complex joint effects of genetic and epigenetic data with other potential health-related variables to dictate clustering.

We cover various aspects such as self-correlation due to geographical ordering, information content in geo-referenced data, and its role as a diagnostic tool for spatial model misspecification. Next, we explore methods for detecting spatial autocorrelation, focusing on Moran’s I and Geary’s C statistics, which provide formal tests for spatial dependency. The presentation explains how to compute these statistics and interpret their results, supported by visual examples and practical applications. We then shift to modeling spatial autocorrelation, demonstrating the use of SAS procedure PROC SPATIALREG. The SPATIALREG procedure enables the application of various spatial models, including Spatial Auto-regressive (SAR), Spatial Durbin Model (SDM), Spatial Error Model (SEM), etc. We also provide examples of geospatial modeling using sets of Turkish Health Studies, which are national surveys having more than 20,000 participants, considering spatial autocorrelation in both the response and predictor variables. We discuss the generation of spatial weight matrices and the fitting of spatial models to the data, highlighting key findings and model performance metrics."""

Diabetes risk is highly heritable and the majority of single-nucleotide polymorphisms conferring diabetes risk are thought to influence insulin production. Conversely, environmental factors such as obesity and diet can elevate metabolic demand and drive resistance to insulin. Individuals display a wide variation in diet responsivity. Consequently, despite many years of research there is no consensus on a single diet most compatible with health and most useful in preventing or reversing metabolic dysfunction in susceptible individuals. Our lab focuses on understanding the genetic factors driving insulin production and diet responsivity. In contrast to many labs studying metabolism using only a handful of highly inbred mouse strains, we focus on mice with high genetic and phenotypic variation. This allows us to perform genetic screens in well controlled experiments with high power, identifying novel target genes regulating metabolism which we can then validate experimentally. This talk will be an overview of our genetics pipeline and some of the techniques we are currently applying to nominate and validate interesting targets."""

This study examined trends in drug overdose deaths related to illicitly manufactured fentanyls (IMFs) among adolescents aged 10-24 from 1999 to 2020. Linear regression was employed to analyze the changes in drug use across this demographic, while bootstrap was used to compare rates of increase. The results indicate that IMFs are implicated in the majority of overdose deaths among youth. Specifically, individuals aged 20-24 exhibited the most rapid increase in overdose rates and the highest incidence of fatalities. Additionally, significant racial disparities were observed in the rates of drug overdose deaths. An interactive web application has been developed to help researchers and the public visualize these trends."""

However, administrative hurdles, Internal revenue services (IRS) regulations and university-specific challenges, often complicate the process of securing and distributing these incentives. Despite their benefits, these difficulties can impact both the quality and quantity of research. Therefore, understanding and addressing these challenges is crucial for ensuring that incentives effectively improve participant engagement and the success of research studies. This study examines the perceived impact of challenges in obtaining gift cards on both the quality and quantity of research, and how these effects vary depending on researchers' professional experience levels. Methods: A Qualtrics online survey was distributed to participants who are at least 18 years old and a person who uses gift cards in research. Participants were recruited through institutional listservs, scientific organization listservs, NIH-funded researcher email lists, and multiple sampling strategies. The experience levels were group into: Trainees (Undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral, resident); Managers (Project managers, Research coordinators); Faculty (Junior faculty -less than 5 years, established faculty-more than 5 years of experience, research scientist). The variable how much do challenges in obtaining gift cards affect the quality of your research were recoded into not affected (Not at all), moderately affected (little bit and moderately), highly affected (quite a bit and very much). How much do challenges in obtaining gift cards affect the quantity of your research were recoded into not affected (Not at all), moderately affected (little bit and moderately), highly affected (quite a bit and very much). Data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 29.0, with emphasis on descriptive statistics and ordinal regression to compare the perceived impact of challenges in obtaining gift cards on the quality and quantity of research between trainees, managers, and faculty, with faculty as the reference group. Results: Among the 242 respondents, there were 117 established faculty, 46 junior faculty, 30 project managers, and 20 graduate students. These respondents were grouped into three categories: 168 faculty, 34 managers, and 42 trainees. Researchers reported that both research quality (73.1%) and quantity (68.3%) were moderately to highly affected by challenges in obtaining gift cards. Ordinal regression analysis showed that trainees experienced a significantly greater perceived impact on both the quality (parametric estimate = 1.10, p = 0.001) and quantity (parametric estimate = 1.68, p < 0.001) of their research compared to faculty. In contrast, managers did not report a significant difference in perceived impact on research quality (parametric estimate = 0.16, p = 0.64) or quantity (parametric estimate = 0.41, p = 0.24) when compared to faculty. Conclusion: The analysis reveals that trainees perceive a significantly greater impact on both the quality and quantity of their research due to challenges in obtaining gift cards, compared to faculty, while managers' perceptions do not significantly differ from those of faculty. Future research should explore strategies to streamline gift card procurement to mitigate these impacts."""

Structural equation models (SEMs) are typically employed to investigate the influences of exposures on outcomes, with model coefficients being interpreted as causal effects. While existing SEMs are effective tools, limited research has considered shape mediators. In addition, the linear assumption may lead to efficiency losses and decreased predictive accuracy in real-world applications. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework for shape mediation analysis, designed to explore the causal relationships between genetic exposures and clinical outcomes, whether mediated or unmediated by shape-related factors while accounting for potential confounding variables. We propose a two-layer shape regression model to characterize the relationships among neurocognitive outcomes, elastic shape mediators, genetic exposures, and clinical confounders. Both simulated studies and real-data analyses demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in terms of estimation accuracy and robustness when compared to existing approaches."""

However, this retrospective analysis is often insufficient for managing future risks. In this seminar, I introduce a conditional ordinal stereotype model designed to assess an individual officer’s propensity to escalate to more serious forms of force. This model is based on a conditional likelihood version of Anderson's ordinal stereotype model. By matching officers who were present at the same use-of-force incident, the model accounts for shared environmental factors, such as location, subject characteristics, lighting, and the presence of an armed offender. This approach addresses a long-standing challenge of environmental confounding in police use-of-force analyses. When applied to use-of-force data from Seattle, the model flags 16 officers with a high probability of being outliers in their local use-of-force networks. The proposed approach expands the limited but growing set of tools available for police executives and oversight authorities to monitor high-risk police activities."""

"""2024-12-02"""	"""Dr. Ramin Homayouni"""	"""University of California, San-Francisco"""	"""Application of AI Methods to Detect Social and Behavioral Factors Associated with Frequent Emergency Department Utilization"""	"""The Emergency Department (ED) offers a unique opportunity to evaluate not only the health of their communities, but also social and economic disparities. Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health (SBDH) are critical contributors to health outcomes, often leading to both emergent and non-emergent conditions that drive ED visits. While health systems have increasingly adopted screening tools to identify SBDH, these tools often fall short in capturing the full scope of SBDH needs across entire patient populations. The ED, despite being a critical point of care where documentation of SBDH could most effectively inform population health interventions, faces significant challenges in implementing these tools due to its high patient volume, intensity of services, and staff shortages. However, robust SBDH documentation in the ED could enable strategies to address barriers such as limited access to primary care and socioeconomic factors that exacerbate chronic health conditions. To address these challenges, developing automated methods to extract and aggregate SBDH data from diverse sources—both structured fields and unstructured clinical notes within the Electronic Medical Record (EMR)—can provide a more comprehensive understanding of community SBDH needs. In collaboration with Corewell Health East (CHE), our team has developed an approach to aggregate SBDH data from multiple EMR sources, including structured screening responses, ICD-10 Z-codes, and unstructured clinical notes. Our current efforts are focused on utilizing this approach to identify SBDH needs within our patient populations and to support outreach initiatives and wraparound services aimed at addressing these needs effectively."""

"""2025-02-17"""	"""Dr. Ali Arab"""	"""Georgetown University"""	"""Assessing Health Policy Outcomes with Interrupted Time Series Design"""	"""Modeling the dynamics of infectious diseases is often challenging and this is exacerbated under data sparsity. For example, modeling the dynamics of a vector-borne infectious disease at early stages is very challenging due to data sparsity (as well as potential lack of knowledge regarding the disease dynamics itself); this is an important issue for modeling emerging and re-emerging epidemics. Moreover, data sparsity may also result in inefficient inference and ineffective prediction for such processes. This is a common issue in modeling rare or emerging ecological, environmental, epidemiological, and social processes that are new or uncommon in specific areas, specific time periods, or those conditions that are hard to detect. Consequently, due to the urgency of modeling these processes in many situations (e.g., in a crisis situation), often there are limited predictor data to use either because of lack of knowledge about the process or the need for fine resolution predictor data. Classic models that are commonly used in these areas often fall short of modeling such events and are unable to provide reliable inference and reasonable or accurate forecasts. These issues require consideration of modeling strategies such as using organic data sources in conjunction with conventional data as well as examining how the learning from previous similar situations can be transferred to improve the modeling and forecasting of the situation under study. In this paper, we discuss strategies for dealing with some of the statistical issues of modeling dynamics under data sparsity including: utilizing blended data (i.e., both conventional and organic data sources), considering a mechanistic science-based modeling framework to model the dynamics of a spatio-temporal based on zero-modified hierarchical modeling approaches, and implementing improved parameter estimation and forecasting through transfer learning. As a case study, we will discuss the spread of Lyme disease in the United States over the past several decades."""
