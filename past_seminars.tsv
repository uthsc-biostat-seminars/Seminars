I will describe my efforts to develop interactive graphical tools for genetic data, using JavaScript and D3. (The tools are available as an R package: R/qtlcharts, http://kbroman.org/qtlcharts) I will focus on an expression genetics experiment in the mouse, with gene expression microarray data on each of six tissues, plus high-density genotype data, in each of 500 mice. I argue that in research with such data, precise statistical inference is not so important as data visualization."""

I will discuss my personal struggles to make my work reproducible and will present a series of suggested steps on the path towards reproducibility (see http://kbroman.org/steps2rr)."""

In the United States, rare diseases affect 30 million patients in approximately 7000 disease areas. Causal inference to inform therapy decisions in this area is challenged by several factors: the patient population is small, the genotype or phenotype is variable, and the disease pathways can be uncharacterized or lengthy. These challenges are not specific to the rare disease setting as they apply more largely to answering causal inference questions in the era of precision medicine where public health decisions rely on subgroups of sample sizes. In 2019, the Food and Drug Administration published documents guiding best practices on data collection, study design and use of registry data in the rare diseases setting. Over the past few years, a few algorithms were published to guide researchers to appropriate study design. This presentation will give an overview of best design practices and innovative analysis methods and illustrate their use with case studies in rare diseases."""
"""2016-02-29"""	"""Dr. Arzu-Onar Thomas """	"""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"""	"""A critical look at non-inferiority trials: benefits and pitfalls"""	"""Non-inferiority trials have the potential to be extremely useful and are designs of choice when placebo controlled trials are not ethical or when a new treatment is thought to be similar in primary outcome to standard of care but may have advantages in secondary endpoints such as quality of life, cost, compliance etc. Designing and conducting non-inferiority trials however can be a lot more challenging compared to a superiority trial as the sources of bias are more abundant and lurk at unusual places such as in intent-to-treat populations etc. Furthermore full interpretation of results may rely on information outside of the trial itself making non-inferiority trials vulnerable to hazards of non-randomized trials. In this talk, I will try to outline some of the issues that need to be taken into account when designing and running a non-inferiority trial and provide guidance regarding best-practices. I will also discuss potential biases that may be present and discuss proper ways of analyzing the data and interpreting the results. The talk will primarily focus on conceptual aspects rather than mathematical details and is intended for statisticians, physician scientists as well as others involved in operational aspects of clinical trials."""

The D3 library can allow researchers to build interactive data visualizations for exploration using a wide variety of charts, networks, and graphs. These visualizations can further help researchers communicate their findings in presentations, and answers questions with on-the-fly interactive investigation of their data. In this presentation, I will go over the basics of the D3 library. I will also demonstrate its potential by exploring a collaborative network visualization of UTHSC researchers. I will explore the co-authorship patterns between basic and clinical scientists, investigate sub-structures, and explore the publication history of prominent co-authorship communities using the network as a guide for exploration."""
"""2016-04-04"""	"""Dr. Jonathan S. Schildcrout """	"""Vanderbilt University"""	"""Epidemiological sampling designs for longitudinal binary data with application to spirometery-based COPD diagnosis"""	"""We discuss an epidemiological study design and analyses approach for longitudinal binary response data.  Similar to other epidemiological study designs, we seek to gain efficiency and increase power compared to standard designs by over-sampling relatively informative subjects for inclusion into the sample.  In particular, we will discuss a design that conducts a case-control sample (i.e., sample cases with high probability and controls with low probability); however, subjects are then followed longitudinally and case-control status is observed repeatedly for each subject. If the sampling variable (case-control status at baseline) is closely related to the binary response (case-control status over time), we are able to observe a sample that is highly enriched with case-visits compared to a standard random sampling design.  We may therefore realize a substantial improvements in power and efficiency.  However, because the design over-samples case-days, we must acknowledge the non-representativeness of the sample when conducting statistical analyses.  We will describe a sequentially offsetted regression approach for valid inferences.  Motivated by data provided by the Lung Health Study we will show that targeted sampling designs can yield valid inferences and can be far more resource efficient than standard random sampling designs for longitudinal data."""
"""2016-04-18"""	"""Dr. Stanley Pounds """	"""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital """	"""Profiling Dialysis Facilities for Adverse Recurrent Events"""	"""Profiling analysis aims to evaluate health care providers, such as hospitals, nursing homes, or dialysis facilities, with respect to a patient outcome. Previous profiling methods have considered binary outcomes, such as 30-day hospital readmission or mortality. For the unique population of dialysis patients, regular blood works are required to evaluate effectiveness of treatment and avoid adverse events, including dialysis inadequacy, imbalance mineral levels, and anemia among others. For example, anemic events (when hemoglobin levels exceed normative range) are recurrent and common for patients on dialysis. Thus, we propose high-dimensional Poisson and negative binomial regression models for rate/count outcomes and introduce a standardized event ratio (SER) measure to compare the event rate at a specific facility relative to a chosen normative standard, typically defined as an ?average? national rate across all facilities. Our proposed estimation and inference procedures overcome the challenge of high-dimensional parameters for thousands of dialysis facilities. Also, we investigate how overdispersion affects inference in the context of profiling analysis. (manuscript: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/sim.8482)"""
"""2016-04-25"""	"""Dr. Parichoy Pal Chounhury """	"""Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health """	"""Causal Effect Among The Treated: Multiple Data Sources and Censored Outcomes"""	"""We develop an inferential framework for estimating the causal effect among ""exposed"" subjects on a time-to-event outcome, based on multiple data sources and censored outcome information. We conceptualize a hypothetical point exposure study where subjects are enrolled and allowed to select their own exposure. Using information from two data sources (one for exposed subjects and one for non-exposed subjects with multiple examination times), we describe a process of manufacturing a dataset that closely mimics this hypothetical study. The identification of the causal effect relies on a no unmeasured confounding assumption based on covariates available at exposure selection and a non-informative censoring assumption. Estimation proceeds by fitting separate proportional hazards regression models for exposed and non-exposed subjects using the manufactured dataset and using G-computation to estimate, for exposed subjects, the distributions of time-to-event under exposure and non-exposure. Using these estimated distributions, we compute a parsimonious measure of the causal effect of interest."""
"""2016-05-23"""	"""Dr. Hyeonju Kim """	"""Preventive Medicine, UTHSC"""	"""Probabilities of Ruin in Economics and Insurance under Light- and Heavy-tailed Distributions"""	"""This research is conducted on ruin problems in two fields. First, the ruin or survival of an economic agent over finite and infinite time horizons is explored for a one-good economy. A recursive relation derived for the intractable ruin distribution is used to compute its moments. A new system of Chebyshev inequalities, using an optimal allocation of different orders of moments over different ranges of the initial stock, provide good conservative estimates of the true ruin distribution. The second part of the research is devoted to the study of ruin probabilities in the general renewal model of insurance under both light- and heavy-tailed claim size distributions. Recent results on the dual problem of equilibrium of the Lindley-Spitzer Markov process provide clues to the orders of magnitude of finite time ruin probabilities in insurance."""
"""2016-08-22"""	"""Dr. Fridtjof Thomas """	"""Preventive Medicine, UTHSC"""	"""R for power users: Compiled R code and parallel computing techniques"""	"""This seminar will demonstrate how to harness the power of R for large numerical computations with focus on simulation studies or other repetitive computational tasks.  I will outline how to write R code with speedy execution in mind and how to investigate where computation time is spent in your R function by profiling your R execution.  A life demonstration will show how R code can be compiled for faster execution as well as demonstrate how to create and utilize multiple cores that your hardware provides.  We will specifically address (pseudo) random number generation and repeatability of parallel/distributed computing as a cornerstone of reproducible research.  All techniques are demonstrated in a Windows 10 environment but are generally applicable to UNIX and Macintosh systems as well."""
"""2016-10-03"""	"""Josh Callaway """	"""CEO/Co-founder/Data Scientist, PendulumRock Analytics, LLC"""	""" The Next Generation of Data Analysis"""	"""According to Moore's Law, the number of transistors on a microchip doubles nearly every 2 years.  As we are now approaching this theoretical limit, Ray Kurzweil points out that technological performance will enter a new paradigm of quantum computing, neuromorphic chips, and 3-D stacking.  We can well extrapolate a similar paradigm shift in many other realms of information technology.  Apps are replacing the middle man and rendering life cheaper in nearly any service imaginable from the hotel industry to hailing a taxi or ordering food.  It appears very likely, as well, that apps will make their way into medical diagnosis and rental services for autonomous self-driving cars.  The boon of this app awakening manifests in the acceleration of declining costs and easy accessibility.  In developing countries, such technology is providing business opportunity where it was previously too expensive.  And, this is not limited to consumer services.  The proliferation of Big Data and high-performance computing has broken barriers in statistics.  Ten years ago, an analytical model that today takes 10 minutes to compute might have taken 10 days.  Furthermore, this is not merely limited to high-cost licensed commercial software.  Breakthroughs have been realized that allow smaller institutions and individuals to spread the work of programming across multiple processes.  Additionally, cheap production of statistical applications is now plausible through open-source platforms.  Therefore, we may be witnessing an analytical singularity in which nearly-instantaneous output can be produced from low-cost input.  Already underway, this is providing a mainspring in technical startups and will fuel a similar paradigm shift in statistics and analytics"""
"""2017-03-27"""	"""Dr. Fridtjof Thomas """	"""Preventive Medicine, UTHSC"""	""" P-values: Too Big To Fail?"""	"""This seminar outlines what we like about p-values and in which situations they are inherently meaningful.  The participant will then get an understanding why their use is somewhat less straight forward in situations arising in observational studies and when very many hypotheses are tested (multiplicity of testing problem).  Details are given why p-values cannot serve as measures of support for a specific hypothesis and why they do not measure ""strength of scientific evidence"" in a general sense.  The American Statistical Association has recently issued recommendations on P-values and reporting of statistical analyses and the Journal of Basic and Applied Social Psychology has banned P values altogether from its research articles.  Are P values still around because they are inherently beneficial or have they simply become so prolific that they are ""too big to fail""?"""
"""2017-07-17"""	"""Dr. Rishi Kamaleswaran """	"""Department of Pediatrics, UTHSC """	"""Continuous Big Data and Analytics at the Point of Care"""	"""Critically ill patients are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for complex, time sensitive, and dynamic care. While traditional patient monitors in the ICU have been used to generate large volumes of continuous physiological data from sensors attached the patient, analytics applied to those systems have largely been univariate and limited. Use of big data approaches, such as continuous and longitudinal event stream analytics through open source software such as Apache Spark allows us to analyze multiple channels of physiological data for prediction of potentially devastating conditions prior to their clinical manifestation. The use of novel discretization and machine learning methods allow us to identify salient 'physiomarkers', such as reduced heart rate variability or arrhythmias. This presentation will highlight recent work and new directions we are progressing at the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital."""
"""2017-07-24"""	"""Dr. Demba Fofana """	"""University of Texas Rio Grande Valley """	"""Gene Expression and Network Analysis"""	"""Analyzing gene expression data rigorously requires taking assumptions into consideration but also relies on using information about network relations that exist among genes. Combining these different elements cannot only improve statistical power, but also provide a better framework through which gene expression can be properly analyzed. We propose a novel statistical model that combines assumptions and gene network information into the analysis. Assumptions are important since every test statistic is valid only when required assumptions hold. We incorporate gene network information into the analysis because neighboring genes share biological functions. This correlation factor is taken into account via similar prior probabilities for neighboring genes. With a series of simulations, our approach is compared with other approaches. Our method that combines assumptions and network information into the analysis is shown to be more powerful."""
"""2017-08-14"""	"""Dr. Ibrahim Abdelrazeq """	"""Rhodes College """	"""Levy Driven CARMA(2,1) vs Realized Volatility"""	"""The Levy driven CARMA(2,1) process is a popular one with which to model stochastic volatility. However, there has been little development in statistical tools to verify this model assumption and assess the goodness-of-fit of real world data (Realized Volatility). When a L?vy driven CARMA(2,1) is observed at high frequencies, the unobserved driving process can be approximated from the observed process. Since, under general conditions, the L?vy driven CARMA(2,1) can be written as a sum of two dependent L\'evy driven CAR(1) process, the methods developed in Abdelrazeq, Ivanoff, and Kulik (2014) can be employed in order to use the approximated increments of the driving process to test the assumption that the process is L?vy-driven. The performance of the test is illustrated through simulation and real world data."""
"""2017-08-22"""	"""Dr. Laura Saba """	"""University of Colorado at Denver """	"""Animal models and statistical strategies for describing the transcriptional connectome and its role in complex traits"""	"""Rarely are the exact same genes associated with a complex phenotype in different populations, e.g., different recombinant inbred rodent panels, different human populations, or different species. In most cases, it is the biological pathway that is important in the etiology of disease rather than an individual gene. In our first analysis, information across several rat populations is combined to identify a set of co-expressed genes in brain that predispose to alcohol-related traits using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and quantitative trait loci. At the heart of this co-expression module is an unannotated transcript that is likely to be a non-coding transcript. When this unannotated transcript is genetically manipulated, not only does the phenotype of interest, alcohol consumption, change but also the transcription levels of many other genes are also altered. This statistical model provides insight about relevant biological processes but may not give detail about the directed pathway from genotype to disease necessary to identify potential therapeutic targets. In an additional study, we performed a similar WGCNA analysis of liver RNA expression levels and associated modules and genetic variants with alcohol metabolism-related phenotypes. In this study, we identified a module that contains multiple isoforms of alcohol dehydrogenase, which is known to have a major role in the metabolism of alcohol to acetaldehyde. Using this co-expression module, we also explored the application of Bayesian networks to further hypothesize about the direction of relationships between transcripts using Mendelian randomization. This model further distinguished transcripts."""

As we increase the complexity of our models, we usually decrease the bias in its prediction. However, increasing model complexity also tends to make the predictions more variable or unstable. In this expository talk, we will examine how the bias-variance tradeoff is exhibited in the context of some common statistical learning methods such as k-nearest neighbors, multiple linear regression, gradient boosting machines, and regularized regression. We will examine their performance in the context of predicting plant fitness using genomewide genotype data."""

This has numerous drawbacks, both limiting new discoveries and impairing our translation of findings into precision medicine for people across the world. To counteract this, the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) Study was developed, currently leveraging genome-wide data from 52,000 individuals representing four multi-ethnic longitudinal cohorts. This large-scale work in diverse populations presents several computational challenges. I will present on our efforts to design new arrays that capture variation in diverse populations. Furthermore, I will demonstrate the use of both statistical and population genetics methods to uncover new insights in complex traits and the role of population structure in elucidating genetic architecture.

Commonly used algorithms include iteratively reweighted least squares (IWLS) and Newton-Raphson methods.  If the objective function depends on a large number of parameters, is not smooth, or is difficult to compute, other methods are needed.  In statistics the EM algorithm is a common choice; in machine learning proximal gradient algorithms are useful. It turns out that both are special cases of the MM (minorization-maximization) algorithm.  This method is guaranteed to improve the objective function in each iteration under general conditions.  We will provide an overview of the three algorithms, and examine their use in penalized regression models."""

The goal is to find QTLs that depend on latitude accounting for weather patterns that vary by year.  We formulate a linear mixed model where traits can be correlated due to genomewide similarities (genetic kinship) and due to weather similarities (""climate kinship"") between environments.

Adolescence transition (puberty) is considered associated with DNA-M change and this change is gender specific. In adolescence, a gender reversal of asthma prevalence occurs, from male predominance of asthma prevalence in young childhood to female predominance after adolescence. Given that DNA methylation may play a central role in susceptibility to asthma, assessing the stability of DNA-M provides a potential to understand the mechanisms of asthma transition during adolescence. The aim of this study was to identify dynamic and stable DNA-M at the genome scale and assess their gender-specificity. Data from children at 10 and 18 years old from the Isle of Wight birth(IOW) cohort in the United Kingdom were included. Epigenome-scale DNA-M was assessed using Illumina 450K and 850k EPIC platforms. Linear mixed models with repeated measures were implemented in our analysis. We identified 15,532 CpG sites were dynamic during adolescence transition in both genders, the level of DNA-M at 1,179 CpG sites is not stable during adolescence transition and this change is gender specific. The findings were further tested in an independent study, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Children and Parents (ALSPAC) study, as expected, the results showed an agreement with the findings from IOW cohort."""

The limited available methods focus on the selection of non-zero individual variables for a single outcome. However, variable selection in the presence of grouped covariates is often required. Some methods are available for the selection of non-zero group and within-group variables for the Cox proportional hazards model. There are no available methods to perform group variable selection in the clustered multivariate survival setting. In this context, the hierarchical adaptive group bridge penalty is proposed to select non-zero group and within-group variables for the independent or clustered marginal multivariate proportional hazards model. Simulation studies show the hierarchical adaptive group bridge method has superior performance compared to the extension of the adaptive group bridge in terms of variable selection accuracy. Sometimes, survival data suffers from high-dimensional group variables. Most existing screening methods address the sure screening property for individual variable selection. The sure group joint variable screening method is proposed to screen independent and clustered multivariate survival data in the presence of group variables. Simulation studies show the sure group joint variable screening method performs better than existing screening procedures extended to the multivariate survival setting. The hierarchical adaptive group bridge and sure group joint variable screening methods can be effective tools, used in a two-step process, in identifying non-zero group and within-group variables for high-dimensional multivariate survival data."""

However, effectively utilizing data from in vitro assays in a predictive model is still a challenging problem. One major difficulty is caused by the small sample size of the training data set in most toxicology problems. Thus, how to utilize data most efficiently takes a premium in predictive modeling of toxicity, and it requires some creative techniques not commonly used in settings with copious amount of data. In this presentation, several examples on how to perform statistical modeling and machine learning in toxicity testing within the constraints of small sample sizes will be discussed. In the first example, a robust learning method was applied to the prediction of the point of departure so that a small portion of outlier chemicals will not harm the overall performance of the model. In the second example, adverse outcome pathway networks were utilized to filter potential predictors from in vitro assays to construct a more parsimonious model with improved performance.

Since the underlying order in a twin, determined by latent genetic factors, is unknown, the observed twin data are unordered. Conventional methods for correlation are not appropriate. To handle the missing order, we model twin data by a mixture bivariate distribution and estimate under two likelihood functions: the likelihood over the monozygotic and dizygotic twins separately, and the likelihood over the two twin types combined. Both likelihood estimators are consistent. More importantly, the combined likelihood overcomes the drawback of mixture distribution estimation, namely, the slow convergence. It yields correlation coefficient estimator of root-n consistency and allows effective statistical inference on the collective genetic impact.

Clinical and echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function was performed at baseline and follow-up evaluations and graded per a modified version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Extreme gradient boosting (XGboost) algorithms were applied, and model performance evaluated by 5-fold stratified cross validation.Results: Median age at baseline evaluation was 31.7 years (range 18.4-66.4), and median age at cancer diagnosis was 8.4 years (range 0.01 ?C 22.7). The average length of follow-up time following baseline SJLIFE evaluation was 5 years (0.5-9). Among survivors, 67.1% were exposed to chest radiation (median dose of 1,200 cGy (4-6,200 cGy) and 76.6% were exposed to anthracyclines (mean dose of 168.7 mg/m2 (35.1-734.2 mg/m2). A total of 117 (9.6%) survivors developed cardiomyopathy during follow-up.

Unlike normal cells, tumor cells are heterogeneous as a combination of dominant and minor subclones with distinct copy number profiles. Estimating the clonal proportion and identifying mainclone and subclone genotypes across the genome are important for understanding tumor progression. Several ASCNA tools have recently been developed, but they have been limited to the identification of subclone regions, and not the genotype of subclones. In this article, we propose subHMM, a hidden Markov model-based approach that estimates both subclone region and region-specific subclone genotype and clonal proportion.

It is of primary interest for clinicians to rank these treatments and select the optimal ones for patients. Various methods have been proposed to evaluate treatment ranking; among them, the mean rank, the so-called surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), and P-score are widely used in current practice of NMAs. However, these measures only summarize treatment ranks among the studies collected in the NMA. Due to heterogeneity between studies, they cannot predict treatment ranks in a future study and thus may not be directly applied to healthcare for new patients.

While the propensity score is defined as the conditional probability of a subject being in the treatment group given that subject?s covariates, the most precise estimation of average treatment effect results from specifying the propensity score as a function of true confounders and predictors only. This property has been demonstrated via simulation in multiple prior research articles. However, we have seen no theoretical explanation as to why this should be so. This paper provides that theoretical proof. Furthermore, this paper presents a method for performing the necessary variable selection by means of elastic net regression, and then estimating the propensity scores so as to obtain optimal estimates of average treatment effect.

With a single covariate subject to LOD, a flexible semiparametric accelerated failure time (AFT) model to accommodate censored measurements has been proposed. We generalize this approach by considering a multivariate AFT model for the multiple correlated covariates subject to LOD and a generalized linear model for the outcome. A two-stage procedure based on semiparametric pseudo-likelihood is proposed for estimating the effects of these covariates on health outcome. Consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimators are derived for an arbitrary fixed dimension of covariates.

"""Abstract: Although machine learning techniques that estimate propensity scores for observational studies with multi-valued treatments have advanced rapidly in recent years, the development of propensity score adjustment techniques has not kept pace. While machine learning propensity models provide numerous benefits, they do not produce a single variable balancing score that can be used for propensity score stratification and matching. This issue motivates the development of a flexible ordinal propensity scoring methodology that does not require parametric assumptions for the propensity model. The proposed method fits a one-parameter power function to the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the generalized propensity score (GPS) vector resulting from any machine learning propensity model, and is called the GPS-CDF method. The estimated parameter from the GPS-CDF method, ?, is a scalar balancing score that can be used to group similar subjects in outcome analyses. Specifically, subjects who received different levels of the treatment are stratified or matched based on their ? value to produce unbiased estimates of the average treatment effect (ATE). Simulation studies presented show remediation of covariate balance, minimal bias in ATEs, and maintain coverage probability.

However, the upsurge of multi-gene panel germline testing has spurred the discovery of many new gene-cancer associations that are not presently accounted for in these models. We have developed PanelPRO, a flexible, efficient Mendelian risk prediction framework that can incorporate an arbitrary number of genes and cancers, overcoming the computational challenges that arise because of the increased model complexity. Using simulations and a clinical cohort with germline panel testing data, we evaluate model performance, validate the reverse-compatibility of our approach with existing Mendelian models, and illustrate its usage."""

Project 1: Gene-based association tests are widely used in GWAS. The power of a test is often limited by the sample size, the effect size, and the number of causal variants or their directions in a gene. In addition, access to individual-level data is often limited. To resolve the existing limitations, we proposed an optimally weighted combination (OWC) test based on summary statistics from GWAS. We analytically proved that aggregating the variants in one gene is the same as using the weighted combination of Z-scores for each variant based on the proposed score test. Several existing methods are special cases. We also numerically illustrated that our proposed test outperforms several existing methods via simulation studies. Furthermore, we utilized schizophrenia GWAS data and fasting glucose GWAS meta-analysis data to demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing methods in real data analyses. Project 2: We used a carefully curated list of 87 previously published genetic variants to determine whether the incorporation of genetic variants with non-genetic variables could improve the identification of cancer survivors at risk for anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy. We used anthracycline-exposed childhood cancer survivors from a ChildrenÕs Oncology Group study (COG-ALTE03N1: 146 cases; 195 matched controls) as the discovery set. Replication was performed in two anthracycline-exposed survivor populations: i) childhood cancer survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS: 126 cases; 250 controls); ii) autologous blood or marrow transplantation (BMT) survivors from the BMT Survivor Study (BMTSS: 80 cases; 78 controls). The Clinical+Genetic model performed better than the Clinical Model in COG-ALTE03N1 (AUC of Clinical+Genetic Model = 0.88 vs. AUC of Clinical Model = 0.81) and BMTSS (AUC of Clinical+Genetic Model = 0.72 vs. AUC of Clinical Model = 0.64), but not in CCSS (AUC of Clinical+Genetic Model = 0.88 vs. AUC of Clinical Model = 0.89). However, the Clinical+Genetic model performed marginally better in CCSS patients without CVRFs where cardiomyopathy developed within 30 years of anthracycline exposure (AUC of Clinical+Genetic Model = 0.90 vs. AUC of Clinical Model = 0.85).

Recent developments in genotype-omics studies have shown promises for discovering novel loci by leveraging genetically regulated molecular phenotypes (e.g., gene expression, methylation, proteomics) into GWAS. However, there is a limitation in the existing approaches. Some variants can individually influence disease risk through alternative functional mechanisms. Existing approaches of testing only the association of imputed molecular phenotypes will potentially lose power. To tackle this challenge, we consider a unified mixed effects model that formulates the association of intermediate phenotypes such as imputed gene expression through fixed effects, while allowing for residual effects of individual variants as random effects. We consider a set-based score testing framework, MiST (Mixed effects Score Test), and propose data-driven combination approaches to jointly test for the fixed and random effects. We also provide p-values for fixed and random effects separately to enhance interpretability of the association signals. Recently, we extend the MiST to depend on only GWAS summary statistics instead of individual level data, allowing for a broad application of MiST to GWAS data. Extensive simulations demonstrate that MiST is more powerful than existing approaches and summary statistics-based MiST (sMiST) agrees well those obtained from individual level data with substantively improved computational speed.

Recently we published an integrated cellular and spatial atlas of 26 primary human breast cancers spanning all major molecular subtypes1. This provided a systematic, high-resolution, characterization of the cellular diversity of the epithelial, immune and stromal cellular landscape. To investigate neoplastic cell heterogeneity, we developed a single cell classifier of intrinsic subtype (scSubtype) and revealed recurrent transcriptional gene modules that define the neoplastic cells. This detailed cellular taxonomy was then used to deconvolute large breast cancer cohorts, allowing their stratification into nine clusters, termed ÔecotypesÕ, with unique cellular compositions and association with clinical outcome. Further, Visium spatial profiling provided an initial view of how stromal, immune and neoplastic cells are spatially organized in tumours, offering insights into tumour regulation. This work is now being expanded to the generation and integration of 100s of cellular profiles and a matching dataset of spatially resolved tumour transcriptomes.

This is difficult because GWAS produces information about SNPs rather than genes, however SNPs are inherently species specific. My lab is helping to develop two complementary methods to address this problem. Both methods depend on translation of GWAS signals from SNPs to genes. In one method, this is done by choosing the gene that is nearest to an implicated SNP. The list of orthologous genes from two or more species are then projected into a previously defined gene network and a random walk is used to defuse the signal to neighboring genes. The overlap between the network defined by each species is then assessed for significance relative to permuted gene sets. In the second method, SNPs are used to predict gene expression and these predictions are used to estimate the effect of each geneÕs expression on phenotype, creating what we term a polygenetic transcriptomic risk score (PTRS). A PTRS can then be used in conjunction with orthologous genes such that a PTRS defined in one species can be used to estimate an analogous trait in individuals from another species.

While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for causal inference in health research, they are impossible or unethical in many common scenarios. Mendelian randomization (MR) can be used where RCTs are not feasible, but it requires stringent assumptions that can be fundamentally flawed when applied to complex traits. Some assumptions of MR can be avoided with using structural equation modeling. In this paper we developed an extension of the Direction of Causation twin model (Neale 1994) that includes two polygenic risk scores in the specification, as an approach to avoid some inherent restrictions of both MR and RCT. We hypothesize that adding a second PRS will generate a more flexible model in terms of identification, whilst maintaining reasonable power and allowing for bidirectional causation. OpenMx software is used to explore the power of such a model and its identification. We arrive at an extension of the Direction of Causation model that can be used both in a twin design or in a extended family design, but at the same time relaxing some of MRs assumptions. We further report the model is well powered enough for current data set sizes (from around 13000 observations or less, depending on the variance of the instruments), and in a range of additive, shared and environmental variances found in common clinical scenarios."""

Diabetes risk is highly heritable and the majority of single-nucleotide polymorphisms conferring diabetes risk are thought to influence insulin production. Conversely, environmental factors such as obesity and diet can elevate metabolic demand and drive resistance to insulin. Individuals display a wide variation in diet responsivity. Consequently, despite many years of research there is no consensus on a single diet most compatible with health and most useful in preventing or reversing metabolic dysfunction in susceptible individuals. Our lab focuses on understanding the genetic factors driving insulin production and diet responsivity. In contrast to many labs studying metabolism using only a handful of highly inbred mouse strains, we focus on mice with high genetic and phenotypic variation. This allows us to perform genetic screens in well controlled experiments with high power, identifying novel target genes regulating metabolism which we can then validate experimentally. This talk will be an overview of our genetics pipeline and some of the techniques we are currently applying to nominate and validate interesting targets."""

However, administrative hurdles, Internal revenue services (IRS) regulations and university-specific challenges, often complicate the process of securing and distributing these incentives. Despite their benefits, these difficulties can impact both the quality and quantity of research. Therefore, understanding and addressing these challenges is crucial for ensuring that incentives effectively improve participant engagement and the success of research studies. This study examines the perceived impact of challenges in obtaining gift cards on both the quality and quantity of research, and how these effects vary depending on researchers' professional experience levels. Methods: A Qualtrics online survey was distributed to participants who are at least 18 years old and a person who uses gift cards in research. Participants were recruited through institutional listservs, scientific organization listservs, NIH-funded researcher email lists, and multiple sampling strategies. The experience levels were group into: Trainees (Undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral, resident); Managers (Project managers, Research coordinators); Faculty (Junior faculty -less than 5 years, established faculty-more than 5 years of experience, research scientist). The variable how much do challenges in obtaining gift cards affect the quality of your research were recoded into not affected (Not at all), moderately affected (little bit and moderately), highly affected (quite a bit and very much). How much do challenges in obtaining gift cards affect the quantity of your research were recoded into not affected (Not at all), moderately affected (little bit and moderately), highly affected (quite a bit and very much). Data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 29.0, with emphasis on descriptive statistics and ordinal regression to compare the perceived impact of challenges in obtaining gift cards on the quality and quantity of research between trainees, managers, and faculty, with faculty as the reference group. Results: Among the 242 respondents, there were 117 established faculty, 46 junior faculty, 30 project managers, and 20 graduate students. These respondents were grouped into three categories: 168 faculty, 34 managers, and 42 trainees. Researchers reported that both research quality (73.1%) and quantity (68.3%) were moderately to highly affected by challenges in obtaining gift cards. Ordinal regression analysis showed that trainees experienced a significantly greater perceived impact on both the quality (parametric estimate = 1.10, p = 0.001) and quantity (parametric estimate = 1.68, p < 0.001) of their research compared to faculty. In contrast, managers did not report a significant difference in perceived impact on research quality (parametric estimate = 0.16, p = 0.64) or quantity (parametric estimate = 0.41, p = 0.24) when compared to faculty. Conclusion: The analysis reveals that trainees perceive a significantly greater impact on both the quality and quantity of their research due to challenges in obtaining gift cards, compared to faculty, while managers' perceptions do not significantly differ from those of faculty. Future research should explore strategies to streamline gift card procurement to mitigate these impacts."""

While existing SEMs are effective tools, limited research has considered shape mediators. In addition, the linear assumption may lead to efficiency losses and decreased predictive accuracy in real-world applications. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework for shape mediation analysis, designed to explore the causal relationships between genetic exposures and clinical outcomes, whether mediated or unmediated by shape-related factors while accounting for potential confounding variables. We propose a two-layer shape regression model to characterize the relationships among neurocognitive outcomes, elastic shape mediators, genetic exposures, and clinical confounders.

However, this retrospective analysis is often insufficient for managing future risks. In this seminar, I introduce a conditional ordinal stereotype model designed to assess an individual officer’s propensity to escalate to more serious forms of force. This model is based on a conditional likelihood version of Anderson's ordinal stereotype model. By matching officers who were present at the same use-of-force incident, the model accounts for shared environmental factors, such as location, subject characteristics, lighting, and the presence of an armed offender. This approach addresses a long-standing challenge of environmental confounding in police use-of-force analyses. When applied to use-of-force data from Seattle, the model flags 16 officers with a high probability of being outliers in their local use-of-force networks. The proposed approach expands the limited but growing set of tools available for police executives and oversight authorities to monitor high-risk police activities."""

Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health (SBDH) are critical contributors to health outcomes, often leading to both emergent and non-emergent conditions that drive ED visits. While health systems have increasingly adopted screening tools to identify SBDH, these tools often fall short in capturing the full scope of SBDH needs across entire patient populations. The ED, despite being a critical point of care where documentation of SBDH could most effectively inform population health interventions, faces significant challenges in implementing these tools due to its high patient volume, intensity of services, and staff shortages. However, robust SBDH documentation in the ED could enable strategies to address barriers such as limited access to primary care and socioeconomic factors that exacerbate chronic health conditions. To address these challenges, developing automated methods to extract and aggregate SBDH data from diverse sources—both structured fields and unstructured clinical notes within the Electronic Medical Record (EMR)—can provide a more comprehensive understanding of community SBDH needs. In collaboration with Corewell Health East (CHE), our team has developed an approach to aggregate SBDH data from multiple EMR sources, including structured screening responses, ICD-10 Z-codes, and unstructured clinical notes. Our current efforts are focused on utilizing this approach to identify SBDH needs within our patient populations and to support outreach initiatives and wraparound services aimed at addressing these needs effectively."""

For example, modeling the dynamics of a vector-borne infectious disease at early stages is very challenging due to data sparsity (as well as potential lack of knowledge regarding the disease dynamics itself); this is an important issue for modeling emerging and re-emerging epidemics. Moreover, data sparsity may also result in inefficient inference and ineffective prediction for such processes. This is a common issue in modeling rare or emerging ecological, environmental, epidemiological, and social processes that are new or uncommon in specific areas, specific time periods, or those conditions that are hard to detect. Consequently, due to the urgency of modeling these processes in many situations (e.g., in a crisis situation), often there are limited predictor data to use either because of lack of knowledge about the process or the need for fine resolution predictor data. Classic models that are commonly used in these areas often fall short of modeling such events and are unable to provide reliable inference and reasonable or accurate forecasts. These issues require consideration of modeling strategies such as using organic data sources in conjunction with conventional data as well as examining how the learning from previous similar situations can be transferred to improve the modeling and forecasting of the situation under study. In this paper, we discuss strategies for dealing with some of the statistical issues of modeling dynamics under data sparsity including: utilizing blended data (i.e., both conventional and organic data sources), considering a mechanistic science-based modeling framework to model the dynamics of a spatio-temporal based on zero-modified hierarchical modeling approaches, and implementing improved parameter estimation and forecasting through transfer learning. As a case study, we will discuss the spread of Lyme disease in the United States over the past several decades."""

Yet, standard methods for estimating the MAP assignment do not have a finite time guarantee that the algorithm has converged to a fixed point. Previous research has found that MAP inference can be represented in dual form as a linear programming problem with a non-polynomial number of constraints. A Lagrangian relaxation of the dual yields a statistical inference algorithm as a linear programming problem. However, the decision as to which constraints to remove in the relaxation is often heuristic. We present a method for maximum a-posteriori inference in general Bayesian factor models that sequentially adds constraints to the fully relaxed dual problem using Benders’ decomposition. Our method enables the incorporation of expressive integer and logical constraints in clustering problems such as must-link, cannot-link, and a minimum number of whole samples allocated to each cluster. Using this approach, we derive MAP estimation algorithms for the Bayesian Gaussian mixture model and latent Dirichlet allocation. Empirical results show that our method produces a higher optimal posterior value compared to Gibbs sampling and variational Bayes methods for standard data sets and provides certificate of convergence."""

While main-only (or ANCOVA) linear models are predominant, cat-modified linear models that include categorical-continuous or categorical-categorical interactions are increasingly important and allow heterogeneous, group-specific effects. However, with standard approaches, the addition of cat-modifiers fundamentally alters the estimates and interpretations of the main effects, often inflates their standard errors, and introduces significant concerns about group (e.g., racial) biases. We advocate an alternative parametrization and estimation scheme using abundance-based constraints (ABCs). ABCs induce a model parametrization that is both interpretable and equitable. Crucially, we show that with ABCs, the addition of cat-modifiers 1) leaves main effect estimates unchanged and 2) enhances their statistical power, under reasonable conditions. Thus, analysts can, and arguably should include cat-modifiers in linear regression models to discover potential heterogeneous effects—without compromising estimation, inference, and interpretability for the main effects. Using simulated data, we verify these invariance properties for estimation and inference and showcase the capabilities of ABCs to increase statistical power.

2025-08-25	Arnab Aich	Florida State University	RMSTSS: A simple way to design clinical trials for time-to-event data	Analysis of time-to-event outcomes from clinical trials commonly uses the Cox proportional hazards model, which is problematic to understand or communicate if its underlying assumption of proportional hazards fails to hold. The Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) is a powerful and clinically interpretable alternative that gives a direct estimate of average event-free survival. Although recent statistical approaches have generalized direct modeling of RMST, there remains much demand for user-friendly software with which to design trials using those methodologies. The RMSTSS package consists of an all-encompassing solution to this need that was created to fill this gap by offering a powerful and flexible set of tools with which to calculate powers and sample sizes. The package contains many different contemporary approaches, such as direct linear models, multi-center stratified models and approaches to dependent censoring and non-linear covariate effect. Offering both speedy analytic and powerful bootstrap-based approaches, RMSTSS allows statisticians charged with designing trials and researchers to design trials quickly and accurately for complex situations at hand and thereby draw more interpretable and meaningful clinical conclusions.

We are utilizing whole genome sequencing data as an epidemiology tool that provides detailed information about pathogens, and further data-rich understanding of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors. Integration of genomic data into routine clinical practice offers new and promising opportunities to significantly improve patient outcomes, thus making hospitals safer. Success of this depends on key requirements: fast enough turnaround time, high discriminatory power, and high accuracy to impact antibiotic stewardship decision, to assist in breaking transmission routes, and to improve interventions made by infection prevention teams. Using clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecium, a pathogen of high clinical consequence collected from patients at UAMS, we have demonstrated early success of our real-time genomic surveillance through a proof-of-concept model in supporting antibiotic stewardship. Further, our study underscores the importance and the benefits of integrating genomic data with EHR data for infection prevention and control.

2025-09-29	Shengqiang Chen	The University of Memphis	The Association Between Metabolomics and Sarcopenia Traits	Sarcopenia is a progressive, age-related condition characterized by the decline of muscle mass, strength, and function, and represents a major risk factor for physical frailty, loss of independence, increased hospitalization, and adverse health outcomes in older adults. As the global population ages, understanding the biological mechanisms underlying sarcopenia has become a critical public health priority. Metabolomics, an emerging field that enables comprehensive profiling of small-molecule metabolites, has advanced knowledge of the pathophysiology of numerous complex diseases. Recent metabolomics studies have begun to explore muscle-related phenotypes, revealing associations between specific metabolites and muscle mass. Building on these findings, the present study seeks to characterize the metabolomic signatures associated with key sarcopenia-related traits—muscle strength, muscle mass, and gait speed—and to uncover which metabolism may contribute to the development and progression of sarcopenia.
2025-10-06	Dr. Ying Ding	University of Pittsburgh	Mini-batch Estimation for Deep Cox Models: Statistical Foundations and Practical Guidance	The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm has been widely used to optimize deep Cox neural network (Cox-NN) by updating model parameters using mini-batches of data. We show that SGD aims to optimize the average of mini-batch partial-likelihood, which is different from the standard partial-likelihood. This distinction requires developing new statistical properties for the global optimizer, namely, the mini-batch maximum partial-likelihood estimator (mb-MPLE). We establish that mb-MPLE for Cox-NN is consistent and achieves the optimal minimax convergence rate up to a polylogarithmic factor. For Cox regression with linear covariate effects, we further show that mb-MPLE is √n-consistent and asymptotically normal with asymptotic variance approaching the information lower bound as batch size increases, which is confirmed by simulation studies. Additionally, we offer practical guidance on using SGD, supported by theoretical analysis and numerical evidence. For Cox-NN, we demonstrate that the ratio of the learning rate to the batch size is critical in SGD dynamics, offering insight into hyperparameter tuning. For Cox regression, we characterize the iterative convergence of SGD, ensuring that the global optimizer, mb-MPLE, can be approximated with sufficiently many iterations. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of mb-MPLE in a large-scale real-world application where the standard MPLE is intractable.
